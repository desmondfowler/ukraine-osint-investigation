# Analyzing Social Media Activity related to a News Event

**Update 3/12/2025:** This repo is indefinitely on hold, and has been for a while. I think Twitter (now X) changed their API when I was working on it, and I never bothered to work around it. 

## Objective

The objective of this project is to use open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools to analyze social media activity related to a news event and identify patterns or trends in the data.

## Tools

For this project, you can use a variety of open-source tools, including:

### Gephi

A powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing complex networks and graphs.

### Twint

A Python library for scraping Twitter data.

### Google Trends

A tool for analyzing search volume and interest in specific keywords or topics over time.

### Excel

Spreadsheets are useful for organizing and analyzing large amounts of data.

## Steps

Select a news event that you're interested in analyzing. This could be a major news story, a social or political issue, or a significant event in your local area.

Use Twint to scrape Twitter data related to the news event. You can search for specific keywords or hashtags related to the event, and collect data such as the number of tweets, retweets, likes, and user information.

Use Excel or Google Sheets to organize and clean the data. You can filter out irrelevant tweets or users, and group the data by date, time, or user attributes.

Use Google Trends to analyze search volume and interest in the news event over time. You can compare search volume for different keywords related to the event, and identify spikes or trends in interest.

Use Gephi to visualize and analyze the Twitter network related to the event. You can create a graph of the network, with users as nodes and relationships such as mentions, retweets, and replies as edges. You can use Gephi's tools to identify clusters of users or influential users, and explore how the network changes over time.

Analyze the data and identify patterns or trends related to the news event. You can use your findings to draw conclusions about the event, such as how it is being perceived on social media or which users are most active in the conversation.

Write up your findings in a report or presentation, and use Excel or Google Sheets to create charts or graphs to illustrate your findings.

Overall, this project is a great way to gain experience using open-source intelligence tools to analyze social media data and identify patterns and trends. By using tools like Gephi, Twint, and Google Trends, you can gain practical skills that are relevant to a career in intelligence analysis, as well as develop a deeper understanding of the news events and social issues that impact our world.
